    <p class="peragraph">I am an undergraduate computer engineering student with a
        strong foundation in mathematical computing, problem
        solving and data structure. Familiar with ReactJS, Node JS
        and mongoDB. Have Interest in competitive programming with
        Java programming language. Also skilled at writing clear and
        concise code that is easy to maintain and troubleshoot.</p>
        <p class="peragraph">It was nearly eleven when I started to return.  The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day.  Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us.  My cousins' man lit both lamps.  Happily, I knew the road intimately.  My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart.  Then abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.</p>
